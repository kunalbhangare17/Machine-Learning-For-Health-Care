# Machine Learning for Healthcare
Educational exercises applying machine learning to healthcare

## Breast_cancer_features.ipynb
An introductory exercise initially designed for 'Machine Learning for Healthcare' courses ([MLmedics.com/](https://MLmedics.com/)).

Uses the **'Breast Cancer Wisconsin' Kaggle dataset** (available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/downloads/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data.zip/2)) and **scikit-learn** (documentation [here](https://scikit-learn.org/)).

Designed to be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Initial inspiration from [this exercise by CodeMD](http://codemd.co.uk/data-science-with-breast-cancer-data/).

## Predicting_No_Shows.ipynb
Training a neural network to predict who will and won't attend hospital appointments.

Uses the **"Medical Appointment No Shows" Kaggle dataset** (available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/downloads/noshowappointments.zip/5)) and **scikit-learn** (documentation [here](https://scikit-learn.org/)).

Designed to be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), but can be run elsewhere.
