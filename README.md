## Predicting_No_Shows.ipynb
Training a neural network to predict who will and won't attend hospital appointments.

Uses the **"Medical Appointment No Shows" Kaggle dataset** (available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/downloads/noshowappointments.zip/5)) and **scikit-learn** (documentation [here](https://scikit-learn.org/)).

Designed to be run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), but can be run elsewhere.
